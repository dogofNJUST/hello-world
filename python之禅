The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.                                           美丽胜于丑恶
Explicit is better than implicit.                                        明确胜于含蓄
Simple is better than complex.                                           简单胜于复杂
Complex is better than complicated.                                      复杂胜于繁复 
Flat is better than nested.                                              平面胜于嵌套
Sparse is better than dense.                                             稀疏胜于稠密
Readability counts.                                                      可读性很重要
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.                  尽管实用性会打败纯粹性，                    
Although practicality beats purity.                                      特例也不能违背规则。
Errors should never pass silently.                                       不要忽略任何错误，
Unless explicitly silenced.                                              除非你要确认这么做。
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.                面对不明确的定义，拒绝猜测。
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.    找到一种-最好的-唯一的方法去做。           
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.       虽然这种方法一开始不是显然易见的，除非你是python之父。
Now is better than never.                                                做好过不做
Although never is often better than *right* now.                         但不假思索就做还不如不做。      
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.               如果实现很难说明，那他是坏想法。
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.         如果实现容易说明，那他可能是好想法。  
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!         命名空间是个好想法，请多加利用。
